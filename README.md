# Sentiment-Analysis
Performing Sentiment analysis using FastText library module 'Dostoevsky' with visualisation and frequency analysis

In this repository we conduct sentiment analysis using FastText technology, the module from the library is called 'Dostoevsky'. In addition, step-by-step instructions are provided on how to collect comments and responses to them, forming a database of more than 50 thousand comments. Based on this, descriptive statistics, visualization, correlation analysis, frequency analysis, PCA, and the formulation of a frequency matrix are carried out. The sentiment analysis itself is carried out both on the processed text using functions, the re module and the stop-word library, and on the original text for comparison and understanding the best solution
